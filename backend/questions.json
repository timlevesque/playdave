    "main_answer": "Find some kind of work you can do from home or self-employed work that you can control - hours, stress level, volume. This would give you earned income needed for Roth IRA contributions. Keep part of the $50,000 as your emergency fund and invest the rest. Without earned income, work with a SmartVestor Pro to invest in low-turnover mutual funds (good for taxable accounts). Consider coding, contract work, or other self-employed options designed around your needs.",

Don't do smart things at the wrong time - buying a house while you have debt and no savings turns a smart thing into a dumb thing. Use Every Dollar budgeting app to track expenses.",

    "main_answer": "You're in range ratio-wise since you'd pay cash and stay debt-free, and total vehicles shouldn't exceed 50% of annual income. However, since you have a company car and this would be a weekend toy, consider waiting. The $20,000 represents most of your net worth. Consider delaying 1-2 years to see what other goals emerge (house, wedding, etc.). If you buy, choose carefully for resale value in case priorities change.

With your income level ($170,000 when both working, about $110,000 from husband), you can save $25,000 in 6-8 months, not a full year. You make $14,000 per month when both working. With no debt payments, you can knock this out quickly. Your frequent disability episodes prove you desperately need an emergency fund.",

Don't go screwing around with get-rich-quick schemes trying to be cool, or you'll lose all the progress you've made. Your smart broke friends will make fun of your tortoise plan, but they're the ones with nothing. Be boring, be steady like the tortoise - he won the race.

You can do real estate investing once you have a paid-for house by saving cash - don't take on more debt. But more importantly, if you work 40 years in a job you don't like, even with $3 million it won't be worth it. You should consider doing something you love - maybe financial coaching since you already help people for free and love talking about money.

You've done really well and proven that you can build wealth while leveraging debt, but it always works until it doesn't. You're an exception to the rule with your crazy income and 30 years of discipline. You can out-earn any poor decisions with your $350K income. Every financial advisor will tell you to do a 30-year over a 15-year so you can give them more money to invest - they're biased. The borrower is slave to the lender, and being debt-free changes your value system, decision-making, and identity. There's a physical weight with debt.",
