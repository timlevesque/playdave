  "main_answer": "Start by increasing your generosity, continuing to invest beyond retirement accounts, and intentionally enjoying your money. Set new personal goals—like travel, a project, or dream purchase—and expect some emotional adjustment as you manage more wealth. Keep your financial systems intact and stay purpose-driven.",

  "prompt": "I run a construction business and want to buy a house, but I owe taxes, credit card debt, and vehicle loans. Should I buy now or wait?",
  "main_answer": "You should not buy a house right now. You have IRS debt, credit card debt, a leased car, and a $35K truck loan—this creates too much financial instability. Pay off the IRS first, then work through the rest of your debts. Focus on creating a business budget and improving cash flow. Homeownership should only be a goal once you're debt-free and financially stable.",

  "main_answer": "Treat the $150K as a down payment for your first home, but don’t rush. Rent for at least a year, settle into marriage, and plan your goals. Upgrade your car only if needed, and avoid lifestyle inflation. Budget together, invest 15% of your income, and keep your finances simple and intentional.

  "prompt": "I’m 57 and can contribute $14K/year for 3 years to increase my pension by $6K/year for life. Is it worth it?",
  "main_answer": "No, it's not a great return. You’d contribute $42K to get $6K more per year, which takes 7 years to break even. At your age, you’re better off investing that money for greater flexibility and potential returns. Only consider the buy-in if you’re certain you’ll live much longer in retirement and have no better use for the money.",

    "main_answer": "No, you should never finance the certification. Instead, both you and your husband need to increase your intensity about getting out of debt. Your husband should take another job, sell the motorcycle, and both of you need to get radical and work together on this. Financing is not the answer.",
