    "main_answer": "You should avoid spending more than half your annual income on a vehicle. A $30,000 car is too expensive for your current income. You should buy a reliable used car for under $15,000, continue building your emergency fund, and begin investing after that.",
    "context": "Ramsey advice suggests that the total value of your car(s) should not exceed 50% of your annual income. Emergency fund comes before car upgrades. A fun car can come later, after investing and income growth.",
    "scoring_criteria": {
      "5": "Clearly recommends a car under $15,000, avoids expensive purchase, mentions emergency fund and/or investing.",

      "3": "General suggestion to be cautious with spending or prioritize savings, but lacks specific car or income rules.",
      "2": "Says a cheaper car might be better, but implies the $30K car could be okay or doesn’t link to income.",

    "prompt": "I'm in Baby Step 2, have $70,000 in debt, and my landlord is selling the condo I'm renting. I can either buy it under market value or stay as a tenant with higher rent. Should I buy the condo?",
    "main_answer": "No, you should not buy the condo. You're still in Baby Step 2 with a lot of debt and no emergency fund or down payment. Buying now would create financial strain. You should finish paying off debt first, save an emergency fund and down payment, then consider buying.",
    "context": "Ramsey advice: Avoid buying a home until you're debt-free with a 3–6 month emergency fund and 10–20% down. Owning a home should be a blessing, not a curse.",

    "prompt": "I'm 23 and have worked several jobs. I find myself becoming resentful at work, feeling undervalued. I wonder if it’s a pattern with me or bad luck with jobs. What should I consider?",
    "main_answer": "You should reflect more deeply on your own expectations and patterns. Resentment may stem from unmet emotional needs or misplaced expectations about fulfillment from work. You should ground your identity outside of work and focus on becoming excellent in one field over time, rather than chasing feelings of fulfillment.",
    "context": "Personal growth and stability often come from committing to a long-term path and building skill. If you keep switching jobs looking for peace, you may never find it. Peace comes from internal purpose and mastery.",

    "prompt": "My wife and I are in Baby Step 2 with $85,000 in debt and expecting our first child. We’re considering selling our house to pay off the debt and start over — should we do it?",
    "main_answer": "Ken Coleman advised selling the house since it's not their forever home and would yield roughly $100,000 after fees, which could pay off the $85,000 in debt and leave a $15,000 emergency fund. He emphasized this would give the couple a clean slate and margin with the baby coming. Rachel Cruze initially urged caution, suggesting they pause Baby Step 2 and pile up cash during pregnancy. However, she agreed with Ken’s strategy if they fully commit to avoiding debt again. She warned that if they don't change their behavior, they risk falling back into debt. Both agreed the plan was solid if taken seriously.",

They owe $254,000 on their mortgage, and the house is valued at $370,000. Austin is getting his real estate license and does DoorDash to supplement income.

    "main_answer": "Legally, you don’t have to pay, but relationally and for your children’s sake, it may be wise to cover the funeral. It avoids family conflict and ensures peace for you and your kids. The cost is small compared to the life insurance, and you should prioritize emotional peace over money.",
    "context": "In emotional situations, protecting peace is more important than strict financial fairness. Funerals are a relational and emotional event—don’t let money ruin family dynamics.",
    "scoring_criteria": {
      "5": "Says she should pay for peace/family unity even though she’s not obligated.",

    "main_answer": "You are not ready to buy. You’re only putting 5% down on a 30-year mortgage, which indicates you should pause and save more. A slight increase in rates is less important than entering homeownership from a strong financial position—10% down on a 15-year fixed mortgage with affordable payments.",
    "context": "Ramsey recommends 10–20% down, 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, and a payment under 25% of take-home pay. Rushing into a home just to lock in a rate is risky if you're financially unprepared.",

  "prompt": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year and want to rent out both our homes and move into a rental together, though we aren’t married yet. Is this a smart move?",
  "main_answer": "No. Since you're not married, you shouldn't treat your finances or real estate as joint decisions. Renting both homes while living together adds financial risk and complexity without legal protection. Keep your finances and property decisions separate until you're legally married. Focus on your individual financial goals and avoid mixing assets.",

  "main_answer": "Legally, no—you’re not responsible since you're not married. But emotionally, you have a deep relationship and should support her however you can. Start by contacting her insurance providers to understand costs and coverage. Then plan what financial help, if any, you can offer. This is about being there for someone you love.",

  "main_answer": "You should not buy a house right now. You have IRS debt, credit card debt, a leased car, and a $35K truck loan—this creates too much financial instability. Pay off the IRS first, then work through the rest of your debts. Focus on creating a business budget and improving cash flow.

Upgrade your car only if needed, and avoid lifestyle inflation. Budget together, invest 15% of your income, and keep your finances simple and intentional.

At your age, you’re better off investing that money for greater flexibility and potential returns. Only consider the buy-in if you’re certain you’ll live much longer in retirement and have no better use for the money.",
